\title{Combine predictions into an ensemble using the log-likelihood}
\usage{
zeitzeigerEnsembleLikelihood(timeDepLike, timeRange)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeDepLike}{List or 3-D array of time-dependent likelihood from
\code{\link[=zeitzeigerPredict]{zeitzeigerPredict()}}. If a list, then each element (for each member of the
ensemble) should be a matrix in which rows correspond to observations and
columns correspond to time-points. If a 3-D array, the three dimensions
should correspond to observations, time-points, and members of the
ensemble.}

\item{timeRange}{Vector of time-points at which the likelihood was
calculated.}
}
\value{
\item{timeDepLike}{Matrix of likelihood for observations by time-points.}
\item{timePred}{Vector of predicted times. Each predicted time will be an
element of timeRange.}
}
\description{
Make predictions by finding the maximum of the sum of the log-likelihoods.
