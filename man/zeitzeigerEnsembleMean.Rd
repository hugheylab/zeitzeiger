\title{Combine predictions into an ensemble using the circular mean}
\usage{
zeitzeigerEnsembleMean(timePredInput, timeMax = 1, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{timePredInput}{Matrix of predicted times in which rows correspond to observations and
columns correspond to members of the ensemble.}

\item{timeMax}{Maximum value of the periodic variable, i.e., the value that is equivalent to zero.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical indicating whether \code{NA} values should be removed from the calculation.}
}
\value{
Matrix with a row for each observation and columns for the predicted time and the normalized
magnitude of the circular mean. The latter can range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement
among members of the ensemble.
}
\description{
\code{zeitzeigerEnsembleMean} makes predictions by calculating the circular mean of the predictions
across members of the ensemble.
