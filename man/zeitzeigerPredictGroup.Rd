\title{Predict corresponding time for groups of test observations}
\usage{
zeitzeigerPredictGroup(xTrain, timeTrain, xTest, groupTest, spcResult,
  nKnots = 3, nSpc = NA, timeRange = seq(0, 1 - 0.01, 0.01))
}
\arguments{
\item{xTrain}{Matrix of measurements for training data, observations in rows
and features in columns.}

\item{timeTrain}{Vector of values of the periodic variable for training observations,
where 0 corresponds to the lowest possible value and 1 corresponds to the highest
possible value.}

\item{xTest}{Matrix of measurements for test data, observations in rows
and features in columns.}

\item{groupTest}{data.frame with one row per observation in \code{xTest}, and columns
for \code{group} and \code{timeDiff}. Observations in the same group should have the
same value of \code{group}. Within each group, the value of \code{timeDiff}
should correspond to the amount of time between that observation and a reference time.
Typically, \code{timeDiff} will equal zero for one observation per group.}

\item{spcResult}{Result from \code{zeitzeigerSpc}.}

\item{nKnots}{Number of internal knots to use for the periodic smoothing spline.}

\item{nSpc}{Vector of the number of SPCs to use for prediction. If \code{NA} (default),
\code{nSpc} will become \code{1:K}, where \code{K} is the number of SPCs in \code{spcResult}.
Each value in \code{nSpc} will correspond to one prediction for each test observation.
A value of 2 means that the prediction will be based on the first 2 SPCs.}

\item{timeRange}{Vector of values of the periodic variable at which to calculate likelihood.
The time with the highest likelihood is used as the initial value for the
MLE optimizer.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements, where the groups will be sorted by their names.
\item{timeDepLike}{3-D array of likelihood, with dimensions for each group of test observations,
each element of \code{nSpc}, and each element of \code{timeRange}.}
\item{mleFit}{List (for each element in \code{nSpc}) of lists (for each group of test observations)
of \code{mle2} objects.}
\item{timePred}{Matrix of predicted times for each group of test observations by values of \code{nSpc}.}
}
\description{
\code{zeitzeigerPredictGroup} predicts the value of the periodic variable
for each group of test observations, where the amount of time between each
observation in a group is known. This function calls \code{bbmle::mle2}.
